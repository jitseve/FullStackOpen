-1st rule of web development: 
	"Always keep Developer Console (f12) open!
	
-Server and browser communicate via HTTP protocol; the network tab of the developer console shows how the browser and the server communicate
	-The general flow is that the browser HTTP GET requests a webapp
	-The HTML code is returned; 
	-When it contains images the browser sends a second HTTP GET request for the image
	-The server replies with the image
	
==== HTML BASICS REVIEW ====
-Used to structure a webpage and its contents
-Consists of elements
	- paragraph <p></p>
	- images <img src='' alt=''>
	- head <head></head> Container for everything you want to include that is not showable content
	- body and title <body></body> <title> </title>
	- headings <h1>-<h6>
	- lists:
		-unordered list <ul> <li>list element 1</li> </ul>
		-ordered list <ol> <li>list element 1</li> </ol>
	- links <a> (a= short for anchor) i.e. <a href=""> </a>

- Making forms:
	-Forms allow user to enter data
	- <input>
	- <form> defines the form container, allowing to determine behaviour using action and method attributes
	- <label for=""> allows you to connect a label to an input
	- <button> allows you to program custom button with javascript behaviour
	- <input type="submit"> gives a preproduced element
	

==== CSS BASICS REVIEW ====

- Style sheet language (!markup !programming languages)
- Use a selector, and in the decleration use the "property: property value;" way to set properties.
	- Decleration is wrapped in {}
- You can style multiple selectors at the same time by seperating the with , -> h1, h2 { properties }
- There are different types of selectors:
	- normal tags (p)
	- ID selectors (#my-id)
	- Class selectors (.my-class)
	- Attribute selectors (img[src] only selects <img src> and not <img>
	- Pseudo-class selector (a:hover) only selects element in specified state
- Style sheet is added to HTML in the head using <link href="" rel="stylesheet">
- Based on box model
